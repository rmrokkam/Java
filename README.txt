    -checkIfSunk method in Boat class checks whether a certain boat has sunk or not
    -missileFire method in Board class is the regular fire method without the penalties and increasing of rounds
    -findBoat method in Board class finds the boat correlated to the chosen x and y coordinates
    -getNumBoats method in Board class returns number of boats in the board
    -getSunk method in Board class returns number of boats sunk in the board
    -getRounds method in Board class returns number of rounds that have gone by in the game
